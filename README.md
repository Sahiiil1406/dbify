Dbify is a platform that allows users to instantly generate CRUD APIs on top of their existing PostgreSQL databases. Users simply provide their PostgreSQL connection URL, and Dbify handles the rest by exposing secure, scalable, and feature-rich APIs without requiring schema migrations or data replication.

## üìê Architecture

Below is the high-level system architecture of Dbify: <img width="1861" height="916" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3188d43f-823a-4c04-8e25-2edad4ba235a" />

### Flow

1. **Users** provide their PostgreSQL DB URL to the **Server**.
2. **Server**:

   * Stores DB URL in Dbify‚Äôs database.
   * Returns `apiKey` and `projectId`.
   * Caches user tables for faster access.
   * Updates cache when schema changes are detected.
3. **Schema Changes**:

   * Trigger events when schema structure is modified.
   * Notify users via **Email**.
4. **Logs**:

   * API request logs are pushed into a **Message Queue**.
   * **Workers** consume logs and store them in **ClickhouseDB** for analytics.
5. **User Dashboard**:

   * Displays logs, usage stats, API keys, and schema change history.
   * Provides graphical analytics powered by Clickhouse.

## üõ†Ô∏è Notes & Recommendations

* Use **PgBouncer** for better pool connection management and efficient horizontal scaling.
* Implement **API linter** to enforce consistency.
* Add **cron job support** for scheduled operations.
* Provide **in-built API documentation** for developers.
* Extend integrations with:

  * **Elasticsearch** for full-text search.
  * **Vector DBs** for semantic search.

---

## üìä Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Node.js / Express (with PostgreSQL driver)
* **Database**: PostgreSQL (user DB), Clickhouse (analytics)
* **Queue**: Kafka / RabbitMQ
* **Workers**: Node.js / Go-based workers for async tasks
* **Search**: Elasticsearch, Vector DBs
* **Connection Management**: PgBouncer
* **Cache**: Redis
* **Email Notifications**: SES / Sendgrid

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Provide your PostgreSQL URL**
   Example:

   ```
   postgres://username:password@host:5432/mydb
   ```

2. **Dbify gives you**:

   * `projectId`
   * `apiKey`
   * Ready-to-use endpoints for all tables in your DB.

## üìñ Documentation

* **Authentication**: Every request must include `projectId` and `apiKey`.
* **Supported Operations**: `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`.
* **Error Handling**: Returns structured JSON with `errorCode`, `message`, and `details`.
* **Schema Sync**: Automatically detects schema changes and updates endpoints accordingly.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

* Rotate your `apiKey` regularly.
* Use role-based access (upcoming feature) for fine-grained control.
* Monitor schema change logs in the dashboard.
* Combine with Elasticsearch/Vector DB integration for advanced search features.
